Hi there!

The Cinnamon managed release package is now available. This means that from now on, updating to the latest version of Cinnamon will be seamless and carefree. Since we've changed the way our releases work, our version numbers moving forward will correspond with the current Salesforce release.

This new package is built on top of the WebDriver JSON protocol, allowing you to take advantage of more service providers (like BrowserStack). Selenium Webdriver now serves as the provider for Cinnamon, allowing you to use any service that supports the WebDriver protocol, including self-hosted instances of Selenium WebDriver. This version is built on top of the WebDriver API so you can easily convert existing WebDriver tests to Cinnamon tests.

Finally, this version introduces concurrent browser testing. You now have the capability to run your Cinnamon tests on multiple browsers in a single test suite.

If you see issues or bugs, please continue to inform us via our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/forcedotcom/cinnamon/issues) page.

Happy testing!
